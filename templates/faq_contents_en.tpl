	<p><span class="b">1.What is the Nagoya University OpenCourseWare (NU OCW) site?</span></p>
	<p>The Nagoya University OpenCourseWare (NU OCW) is a Web site that provides access, in digital format, to some of the course materials actually used in the University's classes.</p>
    <p>The site has two primary objectives:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>to offer the public at large a glimpse into the University's classrooms by bringing course materials to the Web; and</li>
		<li>while helping students engaged in self-directed study, to promote interaction between instructors and students, among instructors themselves, and between instructors and those who are not members of the University community.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The Web site is administered by the Nagoya University OpenCourseWare Committee, which was set up in 2005 under the chairmanship of University's Vice-President in conjunction with the establishment of the <a href="http://www.jocw.jp">Japan OpenCourseWare Alliance (JOCW)</a>.</p>
