	<p>The President of Nagoya University, Michinari Hamaguchi, has launched a program to convert teaching materials used in selected courses into digital format and make them available to the public at no charge over the Internet.</p>
	<p>By thus posting course materials on the Web, the University offers the public a rare glimpse into its classrooms. The site will, it is hoped, help enrolled students engaged in self-directed study, plus promote communication and interaction not only between instructors and students and among instructors themselves, but between instructors and non-members of the University community as well.</p>
	<p>This project is administered by the Nagoya University OpenCourseWare Committee and has been prepared in partnership with the Japan OpenCourseWare Consortium (JOCW), founded in May 2005.</p>
